# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project is a Google Colab-based notebook that leverages NLP and machine learning techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of Twitter posts. It includes data preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation â€” all within a reproducible Colab environment.

## Highlights
- End-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline
- Clean and visualizable implementation in Colab
- Uses `CountVectorizer`, `LogisticRegression`, and NLTK for robust analysis
- Real-time Twitter sentiment inference (offline demo)

## Project Structure
- **twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb**: Main Colab notebook containing code, outputs, and comments.
- **requirements.txt** *(optional)*: List of Python libraries required if you plan to convert this into a package.
- **README.md**: Project overview and usage instructions.

## How to Run
1. Open the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or upload this repo and open from GitHub).
2. Run all cells sequentially or run them section by section:
   - Preprocessing
   - Feature extraction
   - Model training
   - Evaluation
3. Update or import custom datasets in `.csv` format if desired.

## Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk
